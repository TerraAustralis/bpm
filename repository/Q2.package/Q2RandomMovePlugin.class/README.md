This is a sample trivial plugin.
It only shows itself in the middle area if the case number is odd, see #renderOnViewCase:component:.

The action is a random transition.

You can activate this plugin by doing "Q2RandomMovePlugin start" in an admin console. View a case in the Support process with an odd number to see it.

You can then deactivate this plugin by doing ""Q2RandomMovePlugin stop" or by sending #unregister to the plugin.
