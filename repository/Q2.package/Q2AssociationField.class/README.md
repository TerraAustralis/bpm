An association is a combined single selection from two different list, ie the user creates a pair by selecting a key object and a value object which should be associated with each other.

If the first list only has one object, then this field can be presented as a selection field with a single drop down list. Otherwise it typically is presented as two single select lists.

Both lists can also be chosen to be represented as autocompleting text inputs instead of drop downs.
