A filter predicate is a boolean test function that can be configured with a value. The trivial function is equality with the value. Different subclasses represent different functions suitable for different kinds of input values. Each predicate also knows the owning filter. The rank is used when building queries so that we use predicates in the best order - typically predicates that "knows" they are fast through indexes should have a high rank.
