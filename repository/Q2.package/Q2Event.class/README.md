I represent an action in the system that results in one or more events that shall be checked against the user's subscriptions. When I am created, all Q2Events shall be added. Then, during 'run', the events are checked for the subscriptions being trigged.
The trigged subscriptions are collected for each user. At the end if the 'run' phase, an email is created for each user with trigged subscriptions.
