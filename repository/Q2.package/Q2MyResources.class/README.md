I am an example in-image custom resource set, placed as subclass of Q2Resources.

My defaults are provided by Q2DefaultResources, since I inherit my fileSelectors.

My settings can still be overridden by files in the external directory named in #libraryName
because I am a subclass of Q2FileBasedResources.
