The Process permissions graph shows the user at the top level. 

Connected to the user is the user''s categories and the default permission in the process. 

The default permission is one which is not categorized. Instead of this permission does not belong to any user - it will belong to all users in the process. All permission objects in the process with categories shared with the user is connected to these (user) categories. 

At the bottom of the image, all categories in the process is shown (if the currently logged in user is allowed to see them). 

Each permission object draws an solid line arrow to the categories that are defined for this permission objects. The permissions objects also draw dashed lined arrows to the categories where the default level given by this permission is the highest.
