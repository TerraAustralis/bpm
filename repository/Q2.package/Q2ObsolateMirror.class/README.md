A mirror is a definition of a subset of Q2Model that can be created and installed locally on another computer. Mirrors are defined in Q2Model and are owned by a specific user. Each mirror gets its own prefix which must be a unique (short) String. The main mechanism for limiting the contents of a mirror is by specifying only a subset of all processes. Case filters can also be used to further limit the contents of each process (but this is a bit problematic since it makes it much harder to filter transactions correctly).
