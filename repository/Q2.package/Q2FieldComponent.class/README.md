A field component is a non persistent field instance that can hold a value and associated runtime state while filling out the form.
Rendering the field is mainly done through the field instance in order to not duplicate state nor behavior too much. Instead of mirroring the Q2Field hierarchy we use a Dictionary in instvar #state to dynamically hold the runtime state needed.
